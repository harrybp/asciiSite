# asciiSite
A javascript library to create ASCII websites, written just for fun as a challenge. Not sure I will update this as it doesnt really have a pactical use.

For an example go to [here](http://harrybp.github.io).

Tested on Chrome and Edge on desktop and on Chrome on mobile. Likely to be buggy on other browsers as it's very sensitive to how the browser wraps text and such.

### Features:
* Fully responsive design in theory, should adapt to mobile screens
* Navbar with title and links
* Tabs
* Popovers / Tooltips
* Modals (Pretty buggy, not in the demo)
* Support for columns (Only two I think)

Currently the website is defined as a JSON object which is read and rendered by ascii.js. The example linked to above is defined as [such](http://harrybp.github.io/website.js).
