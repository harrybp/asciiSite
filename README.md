# asciiSite

A javascript library to create text-only, ascii-type websites. Tested on chrome only but should work on most browsers.
For an example go to [here](http://harrybp.github.io).

### Features:
* Fully responsive design - adapts to mobile screens
* Navbar with title and links
* Tabs
* Popovers / Tooltips

Currently the website is defined as a JSON object which is read and rendered by ascii.js.
